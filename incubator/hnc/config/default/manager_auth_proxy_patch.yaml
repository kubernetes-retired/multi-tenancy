# This patch inject a sidecar container which is a HTTP proxy for the controller manager,
# it performs RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API using SubjectAccessReviews.
#
# Without this patch, as long as NetworkPolicies doesn't forbid access to the
# manager, any service on the cluster could read its metrics. With this patch,
# we verify that the caller has permission to access the /metrics endpoints,
# using the Kubernetes Service Account token that should already be embedded in
# the `Authorization` HTTP header. See
# https://brancz.com/2018/02/27/using-kube-rbac-proxy-to-secure-kubernetes-workloads/
# for more details.
