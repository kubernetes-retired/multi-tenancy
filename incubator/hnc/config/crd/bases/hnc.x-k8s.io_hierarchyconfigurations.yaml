                      value. The currently valid values are shown below, but new values
                      may be added over time. This field is always present in a condition.
                      \n All codes that begin with the prefix `Crit` indicate that
                      all HNC activities (e.g. propagating objects, updating labels)
                      have been paused in this namespaces. HNC will resume updating
                      the namespace once the condition has been resolved. Non-critical
                      conditions typically indicate some kind of error that HNC itself
                      can ignore, but likely indicates that the hierarchical structure
                      is out-of-sync with the users' expectations. \n If the validation
                      webhooks are working properly, there should typically not be
                      any conditions on any namespaces, although some may appear transiently
                      when the HNC controller is restarted. These should quickly resolve
                      themselves (<30s). \n Currently, the supported values are: \n
                      - \"CritParentMissing\": the specified parent is missing \n
                      - \"CritParentInvalid\": the specified parent is invalid (e.g.,
                      would cause a cycle) \n - \"CritAncestor\": a critical error
                      exists in an ancestor namespace, so this namespace is no longer
                      being updated either. \n - \"HNSMissing\": this namespace is
                      an owned namespace (created by reconciling an hns instance),
                      but the hns instance is missing in its owner (referenced in
                      its owner annotation) or the owner namespace is missing. \n
                      - \"CannotPropagateObject\": this namespace contains an object
                      that couldn't be propagated to one or more of its descendants.
                      The condition's affect objects will include a list of the copies
                      that couldn't be updated. \n - \"CannotUpdateObject\": this
                      namespace has an error when updating a propagated object from
                      its source. The condition's affected object will point to the
                      source object."
