                    description: "Describes the condition in a machine-readable string value. The currently valid values are shown below, but new values may be added over time. This field is always present in a condition. \n All codes that begin with the prefix `Crit` indicate that all HNC activities (e.g. propagating objects, updating labels) have been paused in this namespaces. HNC will resume updating the namespace once the condition has been resolved. Non-critical conditions typically indicate some kind of error that HNC itself can ignore, but likely indicates that the hierarchical structure is out-of-sync with the users' expectations. \n If the validation webhooks are working properly, there should typically not be any conditions on any namespaces, although some may appear transiently when the HNC controller is restarted. These should quickly resolve themselves (<30s). However, validation webhooks are not perfect, especially if multiple users are modifying the same namespace trees quickly, so it's important to monitor for critical conditions and resolve them if they arise. See the user guide for more information. \n Currently, the supported values are: \n - \"CritParentMissing\": the specified parent is missing and the namespace is an orphan. \n - \"CritCycle\": the namespace is a member of a cycle. For example, if namespace B says that its parent is namespace A, but namespace A says that its parent is namespace B, then A and B are in a cycle with each other and both of them will have the CritCycle condition. \n - \"CritDeletingCRD\": The HierarchyConfiguration CRD is being deleted. No more objects will be propagated into or out of this namespace. It is expected that the HNC controller will be stopped soon after the CRDs are fully deleted. \n - \"CritAncestor\": a critical error exists in an ancestor namespace, so this namespace is no longer being updated either. \n - \"SubnamespaceAnchorMissing\": this namespace is a subnamespace, but the anchor referenced in its `subnamespaceOf` annotation does not exist in the parent. \n - \"CannotPropagateObject\": this namespace contains an object that couldn't be propagated *out* of this namespace, to one or more of this namespace's descendants. If the object couldn't be propagated to *any* descendants - for example, because it has a finalizer on it (HNC can't propagate objects with finalizers), the `Affects` field will point to the object in this namespace. Otherwise, if it couldn't be propagated to *some* descendants, `Affects` will contain a list of the objects in those descendants that couldn't be created or updated. \n - \"CannotUpdateObject\": this namespace has an object that couldn't be propagated *into* this namespace - that is, it couldn't be created in the first place, or it couldn't be updated. The `Affects` field will point to the source object, which will always be in a namespace that's an ancestor of this namespace."
