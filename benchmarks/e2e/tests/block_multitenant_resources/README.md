# [MTB-PL1-BC-CPI-2] Block modification of multi-tenancy resources

**Profile Applicability:**

Level 1

**Type:**

Behavioral

**Category:**

Tenant Isolation

**Description:**

Each tenant namespace may contain resources setup by the cluster administrator for multi-tenancy, such as role bindings, and network policies.

Tenants should not be allowed to modify the namespaced resources created by the cluster administrator for multi-tenancy. However, for some resources such as network policies, tenants can configure additional instances of the resource for their workloads.

**Rationale:**

Tenants can escalate priviliges and impact other tenants if they are able to delete or modify required multi-tenancy resources such as namespace resource quotas or default network policy.

**Audit:**

The resources managed by the cluster administrator and that cannot be modified by tenant administrator can be identified by a label configured in the benchmarks configuration YAML file. If no label is provided, then this test looks for any existing network policy and role binding (resource quotas are handled by a separate test) and tries to modify and delete them.
Run the following commands to retrieve the list of resources managed by the cluster administrator

kubectl --kubeconfig=cluster-admin -n a1 get all -l <key>=<value>

For each returned by the first command verify that the resource cannot be modified by the tenant administrator:
kubectl --dry-run=true --kubeconfig=tenant-a -n a1 annotate <resource-type> <resource-name> key1=value1

Each command must return 403 FORBIDDEN
