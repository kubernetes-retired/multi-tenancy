title: Block privilege escalation
benchmarkType: Behavioral Check
category: Control Plane Isolation
description: The `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` setting allows a process to gain more privileges from its parent process. Processes in tenant containers should not be allowed to gain additional priviliges.
remediation: Define a `PodSecurityPolicy` with `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false` and map the policy to each tenant's namespace,  or use a policy engine such as [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) to prevent privilege escalation. You can use the policies present [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/benchmarks/kubectl-mtb/test/policies).
