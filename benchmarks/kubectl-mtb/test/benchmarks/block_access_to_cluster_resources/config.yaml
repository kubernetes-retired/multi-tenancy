benchmarkType: Configuration Check
category: Control Plane Isolation
description: Tenants should not be able to view, edit, create, or delete cluster (non-namespaced) resources such Node, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, etc.
remediation:
profileLevel: 1
rationale: Access controls should be configured for tenants so that a tenant cannot list, create, modify or delete cluster resources
audit: "Run the following commands to retrieve the list of non-namespaced resources

  	kubectl --kubeconfig cluster-admin api-resources --namespaced=false

For all non-namespaced resources, and each verb (get, list, create, update, patch, watch, delete, and deletecollection) issue the following commands:
	
	kubectl --kubeconfig tenant-a auth can-i <verb> <resource>

Each command must return 'no'"
